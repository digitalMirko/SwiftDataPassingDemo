# SwiftDataPassingDemo
Swift - Swift Data Passing Demo - Demo 7 of 30

App created in Xcode 10.3 (10G8) using Swift 4.2, iOS Deployment Target 12.4 and tested on a iPhone Xr Emulator

In this demo app we demonstrate how to code a swift Data Passing Demo app.

When the user clicks the icon they are taken right into the app. They are greeted with the title on top 'Data Passing Demo, 
Screen 1" with a 'Done' Button to the right of the text. Then right below in the body is a large TextView area. The user
clicks the TextView area and a keyboard pops up. They type the text away and then when they are done they just click
the 'Done' button in the upper right hand corner and are taken to another screen via segue. 

The user is greeted with a 'Back' button on the upper left corner followed by the label to the right showing the title 
for this screen 'Data Passing Demo, Screen 2' with a TextView below just like screen 1. The text they typed in is now 
shown on 2nd screens TextView area. When they are done, they just need to click the 'Back' button on the upper left hand 
corner and are taken back to the first screen with the original text typed removed to reveal a blank spot to type in again.

This app demonstrates how easy it is to type in data on one screen then pass it to another screen using a segue option via a 
button clicked to go back and fourth.
